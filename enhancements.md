# AgentChat Enhancements

This document outlines potential enhancements for the AgentChat project and provides detailed instructions on how to implement them using the Phidata framework. Each enhancement aims to improve the agent's performance, capabilities, and overall flexibility to adapt to various conversational needs.

## 1. Enable Knowledge Base

The knowledge base functionality is already implemented in the current version of the AgentChat. However, you can further customize it by modifying the following in the `AgentChat` class:

1. Adjust the `embedder` initialization in the `set_tools_and_initialize` method:

   ```python
   values.embedder = OllamaEmbedder(
       model="your_preferred_model",
       host="your_ollama_host",
   )
   ```

2. Modify the `vector_store` initialization:

   ```python
   values.vector_store = LanceDb(
       uri="your_preferred_uri",
       table_name="your_table_name",
       embedder=values.embedder,
   )
   ```

## 2. Integrate with Database

To integrate with a database for persistent storage:

1. Add the necessary imports at the top of the file:

   ```python
   import sqlite3  # or your preferred database library
   ```

2. Create a new method in the `AgentChat` class:

   ```python
   def integrate_with_database(self):
       conn = sqlite3.connect('chat_history.db')
       cursor = conn.cursor()
       # Create tables and implement database operations
       conn.close()
   ```

3. Call this method in the `__init__` or where appropriate in your application flow.

## 3. Integrate with External API

The current implementation already includes integration with DuckDuckGo for web searches. To add more external APIs:

1. Import the necessary library:

   ```python
   import requests
   ```

2. Create a new method in the `AgentChat` class:

   ```python
   def integrate_with_api(self, api_url, params):
       response = requests.get(api_url, params=params)
       return response.json()
   ```

3. Use this method in your query processing logic as needed.

## 4. Add Custom Tool

To add a custom tool:

1. Create a new class that inherits from `phi.tools.base.Tool`:

   ```python
   from phi.tools.base import Tool

   class CustomTool(Tool):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__(
               name="CustomTool",
               description="Description of your custom tool"
           )

       def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
           # Implement your custom tool logic here
           pass
   ```

2. Add the custom tool to the `tools` list in the `AgentChat` class:

   ```python
   self.tools = [self.duckduckgo_tool, self.calculator_tool, CustomTool()]
   ```

## 5. Enhance Logging

The current implementation already includes comprehensive logging. To enhance it further:

1. Add more detailed logging in specific methods:

   ```python
   logger.debug(f"Detailed information: {variable}")
   ```

2. Consider implementing log rotation or external logging services for production environments.

Remember to test thoroughly after implementing any enhancements to ensure they integrate well with the existing functionality.
